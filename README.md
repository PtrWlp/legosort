# LegoSort

This is my personal help in locating the lego parts i own.
I sorted them by shape into numbered storage cases with compartments and some drawers.
Since there are now over twenty boxes, i spend quite some time finding the right box.

This app will help me locating the piece i need.
It is not an inventory tool like bricklink provides for sellers ( who opt not to sell ). That may be a future developement.

An immense thank-you to Bricklink for providing the inventory files at https://www.bricklink.com/catalogDownload.asp, and Rebrickable for providing ldraw images at https://rebrickable.com/downloads/.
